# Module 4 Challenge - Pandas

# Task
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your local government area. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyse the area-wide standardised test results. You'll be given access to every student's maths and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

# Written Report
- Summary of analysis

  Based on the schools and students represented in the raw data, various calculations have been performed across 15 Independent and Government schools within the taget area.  Calculations include, averages and percentages for maths and reading scores for each school as they relate to the school's budget per student, size of the school and the school type.  Additional grouping of these metrics have also been performed specifically highlighting scoring at a year level.
- Conculsions

  After reviewing and comparing the results for the top and bottom performing schools, there seems to be a trend in the percentage overall passing and the budget per student, being that the lower the budget per student, the higher percentage of students who have passed both maths and reading.  Independent schools also appear more in the results relating to 'Top Performing' schools than Government schools.

  Additionally, schools with a 'per student budget' between $585 and $630 perform the highest, closely followed by schools with a 'per student budget' of less than $585 indicating that higher funds per student does not result in improved student performance in maths and reading.

  Overall, it is also evident that on average, all bar two of the schools performed better in maths than in reading.
